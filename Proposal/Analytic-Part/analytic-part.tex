\section{Concept Analysis}
\hspace{1cm} To begin with, in the “Domain Rough Sketch", 
"sneaker head" represents a market of interest which has “secondhand sellers” who sell “limited edition shoes” to the “customer.” 
The current problem is that Puerto Rico doesn't have a platform that specializes in this. Furthermore, after careful investigation it was also found that big reselling platforms don't have a transparent verification system. Finally, by having a platform like this solves the doubts of getting a "knock-off" version of someone's favorite limited edition shoe and opens a brand new market in Puerto Rico.
\section{Validation and Verification}
\hspace{1cm} The validation procedures ensure that the sneakers meet the needs of authenticity. This includes evaluating the feasibility, applicability and effectiveness of the proposed corrective actions.
Market research is conducted to better understand the needs, preferences and behaviors of the target market related to all the sneakers. Market trend analysis, customer reviews, and competitive research all fall into this category.
Seller verification is being taken account by rigorously verifying the legitimacy of the merchant and the sneakers they sell. This includes verifying the identity of the seller.
User acceptance testing is conducted to ensure that the website meet the needs of the user. Verification of said features will be verified using feedback from domain experts and stakeholders by some of the following methods:
\begin{itemize}
  \item {A/B testing}
  \item {Requirements Testing}
  \item {Domain Engineering testing}
  \item {Interface Engineering testing}
\end{itemize}
Any addition to the project will be analyzed by the team members to determine if it’s aligned with the primary needs of the stakeholders. During the development phase, the team will have open discussions to ensure that the system is developed by the best practices. Buyers must see an Enhanced experience with the process of buying secondhand sneakers by the elimination of counterfeit products.
