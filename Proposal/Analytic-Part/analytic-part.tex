\section{Concept Analysis}
\hspace{1cm} To begin with, in the “Domain Rough Sketch", 
"sneaker head" represents a market of interest which has “secondhand sellers” who sell “limited edition shoes” to the “customer.” 
The current problem is that Puerto Rico doesn't have a platform that specializes in this. Furthermore, after careful investigation it was also found that big reselling platforms don't have a transparent verification system. Finally, by having a platform like this solves the doubts of getting a "knock-off" version of someone's favorite limited edition shoe and opens a brand new market in Puerto Rico.
\section{Validation and Verification}
\hspace{1cm} The validation procedures ensure that the sneakers meet the needs of authenticity. This includes evaluating the feasibility, applicability and effectiveness of the proposed corrective actions.
Market research is conducted to better understand the needs, preferences and behaviors of the target market related to all the sneakers. Market trend analysis, customer reviews, and competitive research all fall into this category.
Seller verification is being taken account by rigorously verifying the legitimacy of the merchant and the sneakers they sell. This includes verifying the identity of the seller.
User acceptance testing is conducted to ensure that the website meet the needs of the user. Verification of said features will be verified using feedback from domain experts and stakeholders by some of the following methods:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A/B testing
  \item Requirements Testing
  \item Domain Engineering testing
  \item Interface Engineering testing
\end{itemize}
Any addition to the project will be analyzed by the team members to determine if it’s aligned with the primary needs of the stakeholders. During the development phase, the team will have open discussions to ensure that the system is developed by the best practices. Buyers must see an Enhanced experience with the process of buying secondhand sneakers by the elimination of counterfeit products.
\section{Software Design}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The system does have a SQLite database that stores customer information and shoe entries.
  \item Due to the system having a SQL database, a shoe entry can be modified before an after publishing an entry.
  \item Due to the system having login forms, customer/seller information can be modified before profile creation.
  \item Due to the system having a SQL database, customer/seller information can be modified before profile creation.
  \item Due to the system having a SQL database, shoe entries can be filtered out by criteria such as name, brand, model name, shoe size or by date added.
  \item Due to the system having a SQL database, the latest entries can be retrieved from the database.
  \item Due to the system having a SQL database, an entry can be marked as sold after a it has been purchased.
  \item Due to the system having a SQL database, customers/sellers can be blacklisted by an administrator if necessary.
  \item Due to the system having a SQL database, the uniqueness of product entries can be verified.
  \item The seller field for in the database has first/last name, email, customername, password, business name and business address attributes.
  \item The customer field for in the database has first/last name, email, customername, password and address attributes.
  \item The customer field for in the database has name,date added, model, brand, shoe size, price, the system path for a set of pictures for the product and the system path for the verification video for the product.
  \item The system allows a customer to sign up via a sign up forum with first name, last name, email, customername, password and address fields.
  \item The system allows a customer to sign in via a sign in forum with first name, last name, email, customername, password and address fields.
  \item The system has a homepage with a collapsible navigation bar that is screen reader compatible that has a login and sign up and a footer with contact information.
  \item The system has individual pages for a product entry that contains the name,date added, model, brand, shoe size, price, a set of pictures for the product and the verification video for the product.
\end{itemize}
