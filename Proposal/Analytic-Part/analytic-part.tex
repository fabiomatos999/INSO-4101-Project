\section{Concept Analysis}
\hspace{1cm} To begin with, in the “Domain Rough Sketch", 
"sneaker head" represents a market of interest which has “secondhand sellers” who sell “limited edition shoes” to the “customer.” 
Within the requirements a “database” within the “system-to-be” stores the sellers, users, and shoes information. 
Furthermore, the “system-to-be” compiles a list of shoes based on their unique brands and models. 
This concept allows “users” to purchase an item within a list , mark them as sold and blacklist items. 
Finally, the “system-to-be” ensures that the “users” get a guaranteed legitimate limited time shoe.
