\subsection{Narrative}
\hspace{1cm} Currently, the ``Sneaker Head'' shoe market is ripe with fraudulent and illegitimate products. Thus purchasing products from this second hand market is a risk filled endeavor. Furthermore, the few currently existing platforms that specialize in the resale of ``Sneaker Head'' shoes like GOAT.com are not open with their authentication process for shoes sold on their platform, plus there is no alternative like GOAT.com in Puerto Rico. A seller can sign up to SNKRS Trust and can then request that their shoe be listed on SNKRS Trust. Once the request is processed, the seller must send their shoe to the company to the reviewed and depending on if the product passed the review, the product is listed on SNKRS Trust along side with pictures of the product and a video recording of the product. After, a customer can sign up/ log in to SNKRS Trust and purchase a listed product.
