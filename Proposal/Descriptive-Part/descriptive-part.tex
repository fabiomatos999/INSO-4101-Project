\section{Domain Description}
\subsection{Domain Rough Sketch}
Our application domain of interest is the \textbf{sneaker head} market domain. In this domain there are \textbf{secondhand sellers} who sell \textbf{limited edition shoes} to \textbf{customers}. Currently in Puerto Rico there is no platform that specializes in the \textbf{reselling} of \textbf{sneaker head} shoes with the \textbf{guarantee} that they are \textbf{legitimate}. From our initial meetings it was found that the second hand shoe market is a booming market with projected year over year growth. With this in mind we further set on finding problems across the clothing industry, mainly that counterfit items are rampant. The clothing industry has the highest rates of counterfit products of all products industries, commonly referred as ``knock off'', even having common idioms like ``You bought that from wish, didn't you?'', referring to the much inferior quality of the products. Usually knock off products are illegitimately manufactured by unauthorized factories or the products are from the same factories as the legitimate ones but are ones that do not pass quality assurance verification. ``Sneaker heads'' refer to a type of individual that has a keen like of limited editions sneakers from companies like Nike and Adidas like Jordans and Yeezes respectively.  In marketplaces like ebay, craigslist and Facebook marketplace face to face interaction with sellers with can be dangerous due to a chance of the listing being a scam or even worse. Therefore, platforms like GOAT.com were creating as a middleman between resellers and buyers where there is verification of the shoes. The problem with this current arrangement is that the verification process is not open to customers and relies on the prestige or reputation of the platform as enough evidence that the verification process occurred at all.
\subsection{Terminology}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Shoe: An item of footwear bought and sold as a commodity.
  \item Limited edition shoes: Shoes that are extremely sought after, yet are hard to find due to low stock and high demand. Because of high demand and low stock, they are resoled at a higher price and there is a lot of counterfeit with these kinds of shoes.
  \item Guarantee: A promise of authenticity.
  \item Legitimate shoe: A shoe that was manufactured in the factories from a known brand. For example, Nike shoes being made in Nike factories.

  \item Platform: A tool that allows a user to accomplish a task.
  \item Sell: The act of relinquishing ownership of an item in exchange for currency.

\subsection{User Stories}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item As a buyer, I prefer being able to search for original limited edition shoes and make secure purchases.
  \item As a seller, I would like to have validation that my products are original and not counterfeits.
  \item As a buyer, I would like have the ability to buy limited edition shoes without worrying that the seller is selling counterfeits.
  \item As a business, promoting the security and trust of the store would encourage more users to buy shoes and benefit us.
  \item As a business from Puerto Rico, it will help the e-commerce platform by having a more reliable platform that revolves around security.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Narrative}
\hspace{1cm} Currently, the ``Sneaker Head'' shoe market is ripe with fraudulent and illegitimate products. Thus purchasing products from this second hand market is a risk filled endeavor. Furthermore, the few currently existing platforms that specialize in the resale of ``Sneaker Head'' shoes like GOAT.com are not open with their authentication process for shoes sold on their platform. A seller can sign up to SNKRS Trust and can then request that their shoe be listed on SNKRS Trust. Once the request is processed, the seller must send their shoe to the company to be reviewed and depending on if the product passed the review, the product is listed on SNKRS Trust along side with pictures of the product and a video recording of the review process of the product. After that, a customer can sign up/ log in to SNKRS Trust and purchase a listed product.

\section{Implementation}
\subsection{ER Concept Analysis Diagram}
\hspace{1cm} The ER diagram for the sneakers shopping system consist of tables such as User, Shoes, Order,
OrderHas, Brand, Model, Cart and Wishlist. The relationship and schema should allow for efficient
querying and retrieval of data. When implementing the system, it will be important to ensure that the
database design aligns with the ER diagram to ensure proper storage. The system will communicate with
the database to display and store information on the platform.
