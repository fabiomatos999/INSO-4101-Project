\section{Current Situation, Needs, Ideas}
\subsection{Current Situation}
\hspace{1cm} The second hand shoe market being projected to have a market size of \$893.9 million \cite{SecondHandDesigner}, with expected growth at a steady rate of 7.8\% \cite{SecondHandDesigner2022}, is it safe to assume that this market is not going away any time soon. Being a booming second hand market, there will be malicious actors within. Mainly that the shoe industry is the most affected my counterfeit products \cite{InfographicIndustriesMost2019}. Furthermore, since it is a booming industry, counterfeiting is on the rise and knowledge of identifying counterfeits are scarce and ever evolving. This is further compounded by the fact that the barrier to entry for this industry is quite high, so resellers of legitimate shoes are financially discouraged in making their product available and thus making it seem that counterfeit products are more prevalent then they actually are. In the continental USA, there are platforms like GOAT.com that are a market place for the reselling of shoes but none exist for Puerto Rico with a focus on independent verification and validation of the legitimacy of the products being sold on the platform.
\subsection{Need}
\hspace{1cm} There currently is a need for a platform that can openly host resellers of limited edition shoes, whilst providing transparent verification of each and every product hosted on the platform. Since there is a large proportion of counterfeit products within the second hand shoe market, an open repository of information about counterfeit products is a must in order subside the purchase of counterfeit products on all platforms. At the time of this proposal, there is no such platform that meets all of these criteria. Therefore, there is a need to develop a:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Domain Description
  \item Requirements Prescription
  \item Software Design
  \item Implementation
\end{itemize}
for a platform that can meet all of the aforementioned criteria.
\subsection{Ideas}
Our idea for helping alleviating this problem is creating an online platform where buyers and sellers alike can have transparency and honesty throughout the entire shopping process. The big distinguishing feature of this platform is the recording of the review process of the product in order grantee authenticity of the product on sale.
\section{Scope, Span, and Synopsis}
\subsection{Scope and Span}
Scope:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The domain for this project is the second hand shoe market.
  \item This platform will provide the ability to search, view and buy shoes and showcase the review process on every listing on the platform.
  \item As for the implementation for this platform it will be a Web Application that will function on Chromium based browsers, Firefox and Safari and both desktop and mobile platforms.
        \item This project will also delve into domain engineering, requirements engineering, software architecture, interface requirements, machine requirements, events, actions and behaviors required for this project.
\end{itemize}
Span:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Time Frame: 8 Weeks and 6 Days, to submit on May 3, 2023.
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Front End: Bootstrap and Jinja \cite{JinjaJinjaDocumentation}
          \item Back End: Flask\cite{abriviation citation style}
          \item Architecture: REST API
        \end{itemize}
  \item Agile methodology:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Creating the home page.
          \item Creating the log in portal.
          \item Automating the creation of new pages for newly added products.
          \item Implement search by brand, name, date added and price.
          \item Connect front end with the database.
          \item Optimize the addition of files to the database.
        \end{itemize}
  \item Deliverable:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item The deployment of the project via a web app.
          \item 1 progress report and 1 final report.
          \item Possible feature additions and bug fixes upon deployment.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Synopsis}
There is a booming second hand market for limited edition shoes, however the shoe industry as a whole is ripe with fraudulent products. The fashion industry as a whole is well known for the manufacturing of ``Knock Off'' products that are either sold at a discounted price or sold as if they where a legitimate product. In the United States of America, there are online platforms life GOAT.com that serve as a marketplace for limited edition shoes they do not offer shipping to Puerto Rico and are incredibly secretive about the individual items on sale. Our platform focuses on the Puerto Rican market with a specific emphasis on transparency and openness. This platform will be able to serve as storefront for limited edition shoes, while being transparent to the buyer who the seller is and display evidence that the products are what they say they are. In terms of implementation detains, this web application will be using bootstrap and jinja in python for the front and Flask in python for the back end and will be deployed in roughly 8 weeks. After deployment it is expected that users will be able to buy limited edition shoes with the confidence that what they are buying is legitimate and in the condition the seller clains it to be in.
