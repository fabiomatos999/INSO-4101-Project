\section{Current Situation, Needs, Ideas}
\subsection{Current Situation}
\hspace{1cm} The second hand shoe market being projected to have a market size of \$893.9 million \cite{SecondHandDesigner}, with expected growth at a steady rate of 7.8\% \cite{SecondHandDesigner2022}, is it safe to assume that this market is not going away any time soon. Being a booming second hand market, there will be malicious actors within. Mainly that the shoe industry is the most affected my counterfeit products \cite{InfographicIndustriesMost2019}. Furthermore, since it is a booming industry, counterfeiting is on the rise and knowledge of identifying counterfeits are scarce and ever evolving. This is further compounded by the fact that the barrier to entry for this industry is quite high, so resellers of legitimate shoes are financially discouraged in making their product available and thus making it seem that counterfeit products are more prevalent then they actually are. In the continental USA, there are platforms like GOAT.com \cite{GOATCom} that are a market place for the reselling of shoes but none exist for Puerto Rico with a focus on independent verification and validation of the legitimacy of the products being sold on the platform.
\subsection{Need}
\hspace{1cm} There currently is a need for a platform that can openly host resellers of limited edition shoes, whilst providing transparent verification of each and every product hosted on the platform. Since there is a large proportion of counterfeit products within the second hand shoe market, an open repository of information about counterfeit products is a must in order subside the purchase of counterfeit products on all platforms. At the time of this proposal, there is no such platform that meets all of these criteria. Therefore, there is a need to develop a
\begin{itemize}
  \item Domain Description
  \item Requirements Prescription
  \item Software Design
  \item Implementation
\end{itemize}
for a platform that can meet all of the aformentioned criteria.
